    <h1>Crime Data Analysis - 2025</h1>

    <h2>Introduction to the Crime Dataset</h2>
    <p>The <b>Crime Incidents in 2025</b> dataset provides a comprehensive overview of criminal activities recorded in a metropolitan area throughout the year. The dataset includes essential information such as:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Crime Type (OFFENSE):</span> Categorizes offenses such as theft, robbery, and assault.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Time & Shift:</span> Identifies whether crimes occurred in the day, evening, or midnight shift.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Method Used:</span> Specifies the means of crime (e.g., gun, knife, or other tools).</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Location Details:</span> Includes latitude, longitude, district, and ward classifications.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Timestamp:</span> Captures the exact date and time of reported crimes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This dataset enables detailed crime trend analysis, hotspot detection, and predictive modeling to assist law enforcement in resource allocation and crime prevention.</p>

        <img src="crime_by_day_of_week.png" alt="Crime by Day of the Week">
        <p>This bar chart breaks down crime frequency by day of the week. 
        Weekends tend to have higher crime rates, likely due to increased nightlife and gatherings.</p>

        <h2>Crime Rate per Capita by District</h2>
        <img src="crime_rate_per_capita.png" alt="Crime Rate Per Capita">
        <p>This visualization calculates crime rate per 100,000 people in each district, allowing for a fair comparison across different population sizes.</p>

        <h2>Crime Seasonality Analysis (Rolling Average)</h2>
        <img src="crime_seasonality.png" alt="Crime Seasonality">
        <p>A rolling average smooths out short-term fluctuations and helps visualize seasonal trends in crime activity.</p>

        <h2>Crime Predictability – Autocorrelation Analysis</h2>
        <img src="crime_autocorrelation.png" alt="Crime Predictability">
        <p>This autocorrelation function (ACF) plot determines how past crime rates influence future crime occurrences.</p>

        <h2>KDE Plot – Crime Occurrences by Time of Day</h2>
        <img src="crime_kde_by_hour.png" alt="KDE Plot Crime by Hour">
        <p>The KDE plot shows the density of crimes occurring at various times of the day, providing a smooth probability distribution.</p>

        <h2>Violin Plot – Crime Distribution by Method</h2>
        <img src="crime_violin_method.png" alt="Violin Plot Crime by Method">
        <p>This violin plot represents crime severity across different methods, showing distribution spread and density.</p>

        <h2>Hexbin Plot – Geospatial Crime Density</h2>
        <img src="crime_hexbin.png" alt="Hexbin Plot Crime Density">
        <p>Using hexagonal bins, this visualization clusters crime occurrences spatially, providing insight into high-density regions.</p>

        <h2>Joint Plot – Relationship Between Crime Time and Latitude</h2>
        <img src="crime_jointplot_time_latitude.png" alt="Joint Plot Crime Time Latitude">
        <p>This joint plot examines how crime occurrences relate to time of day and geographic location.</p>

        <h2>Crime Hotspots Using K-Means Clustering</h2>
        <img src="crime_hotspots_kmeans.png" alt="Crime Hotspots K-Means">
        <p>Clustering crime locations into groups using K-Means identifies crime-prone areas for resource allocation.</p>

        <h2>Crime Hotspots Using DBSCAN</h2>
        <img src="crime_hotspots_dbscan.png" alt="Crime Hotspots DBSCAN">
        <p>DBSCAN detects densely packed crime clusters, marking outliers for further investigation.</p>

        <h2>Crime Anomalies Using Isolation Forest</h2>
        <img src="crime_anomalies.png" alt="Crime Anomalies">
        <p>The Isolation Forest model identifies unusual crime patterns, flagging outliers that differ significantly from typical crime distributions.</p>
